A second migration, this time to another country, Uruguay. In here I met a
wonderful team of kind and smart people, Rootstrap.

## Senior Developer & Tech Lead Roles

I'd highlight two projects that represented several challenges, both
technically and organization wise, and that ended up being wonderful learning
experiences.

### 1. Givetide:

</p>

Givetide was backend-heavy, I had to integrate with several API's given
the business model: the product relied on rounding up users' bank transactions,
transferring donations to charity agencies, connecting to database of available
charities, and a few other structural intricacies in-between. It was a great experience,
this time powered by Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, redis, and Swift for iOS.

### 2. Rigz:

<p className="flex flex-row justify-center">
  <img src="/software/rigz.png" />
</p>

The first challenge with Rigz was the complexity of the product: They served as
intermediary providers for Amazon's deliveries networks. The second biggest challenge
was the effort in refactoring, creating a strategy
to update a really large codebase, fully active with millions of users and daily
transactions. I successfully helped the team create a plan for this transition,
and implemented the first modules of the new version.

## Product Manager

With Rootstrap I had the most stable working environmnent so far (about five years),
and I was able to dive into other areas I hadn't explored before. The Product Owner and eventually
Product Manager years were very valuable, I learned the subtleties of negotiating
with clients and different stakeholders, interacting between disciplines and being able
to align plans and expectations, while remaining aware of the businesses ambitions and realities.

There were a few projects in which I was dedicated to this role during the duration of several
release cycles, but beyond that, I served as the technical leader of a separate process within the agency that gave me
the opportunity to work with many different products in a relatively short period of time.
It was called **discovery**

### Discovery Process

<p className="flex flex-row justify-center">
  <img src="/software/discovery-steps.png" />
</p>

In the discovery process I defined, alongside designer and business leaders,
the scope of a project, the roadmap towards the next versions of a product, if it was
an MVP then we decided how to prioritize the work to maximize value with the major
features of the product. If there were particular technical risk that required research
and prototyping, I worked in identifying those areas that would take extraordinary work,
and according to the conditions I would do some of the initial exploratory implementation
to assess feasibility and estimate further efforts.

It was an extremely prolific period, and honestly I lost count of how many products
we helped give birth during this process, but they all sit somewhere in my head, and the
accumulated learnings I gratefuly keep and recall when needed :)

But a big change was slowly brewing during those five years, and we've arrived at the
[sabbatical period.](/software/articles/tech-sabbatical)
